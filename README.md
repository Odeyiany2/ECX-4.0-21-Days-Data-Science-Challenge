# ECX 4.0 21 Days Data Science Challenge: Iris Classification

This is a challenge organized by the Engineering Career Expo Unilag. A challenge to test our data science skills for 21 days. 
In this challenge, I dealt with the Iris dataset and built a model that predicts the specie of an Iris by its measurements. 

## Tools 
The following tools were used for different areas of the project:
* Python Libraries:
  - `Pandas`: for data analysis and manipulation
  - `Seaborn`: a library based on matplotlib and it provides a high-level interface for data visualization
  - `matplotlib`: for data visualization
  - `Joblib`: Saving our model for deployment

* Scikit Learn (Python Machine Learning Library):
  - `GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV`: Hyperparameter tuning
  - `StandardScaler`: for standardization of numeric features
  - `LabelEncoder`: for encoding oyr categorical features
  - `RandomForestClassifier, SVC, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier`: ML algorithm for classification problems
  
* Evaluation Metrics:
  - `Accuracy Score`: Number of correctly predicted class over the total classes 
  - `Precision`: ratio of correctly predicted positive classes over the total positive classes
  - `Recall`: ratio of correctly predicted positive class over the total classes
  - `Classification report`: a report showing precision, recall and F-1 score 
  - `ROC Curve`: a plot showing the true positive rate(TPR) over false positive rate(FPR)
  - `Confusion matrix`: a table for assessing the quality of our classification model prediction
    
* Deployment: `Streamlit`
